# Portfolio-Optimizer
Quantitative Finance &amp; Optimization, Self-Initiated Project


Implemented Markowitz mean-variance optimization framework to construct efficient portfolios, maximizing risk-adjusted returns for 10+ asset combinations using historical price data

Plotted efficient frontier visualizing optimal risk-return trade-offs, identifying portfolios with Sharpe ratios 25% higher than equal-weight benchmarks

Leveraged NumPy and SciPy optimization algorithms to solve constrained quadratic programming problems, processing covariance matrices and expected returns for portfolio weight allocation
